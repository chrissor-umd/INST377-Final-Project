Welcome to the Breaking Bad Quote Game!

Each round, you'll be given a quote from Breaking Bad,
only with a few words missing. To score, fill in the missing words.
Depending on your difficulty, you may need to fill more words each round.
for each word you get right, you'll receive one point, but any time you get a word wrong,
the mistakes counter will go up. Once you get too many mistakes, the game is over.
If you don't get the word just right, a synonym will prevent the mistake counter from going
up, but you won't be rewarded any points.

Good luck, and enjoy the game!
